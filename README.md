# Solidity_Mint_Token

### Solidity Token Implementation

## Outline

The main goal of this project is to establish a secure and resilient digital infrastructure by creating a personalized token using the Solidity language.

## Project Recap

I have developed a token called "Rosh," which is abbreviated as "Son" The total supply of this token is recorded. Any "Ban" tokens minted by someone will be included in the overall supply. Similarly, if someone chooses to burn these tokens, the total supply will decrease accordingly.

## Installation Process

The primary tool used for implementing the project was the Remix Online IDE. Furthermore, the repository contains the 'Ros.sol' file, which can be easily integrated with GitHub.

## Operation Process

Efficient management of the code execution was achieved using the remix.ide interface.

## Procedure Brief

* Create a folder to start the process.

* If the Remix tool is configured for automatic compilation and execution, it will do so. Otherwise, manually select the "Compile and Run" option from the menu.

* Once the compilation is successful, deploy the contract to obtain the account address.

* You will receive a confirmation when the deployment process is completed successfully.

* Initially, the account balance will be set to zero.

* To generate tokens, click on the "Mint" button and paste your account address. Enter the desired quantity of tokens (900) and click "Transact" to add them to your account.

* To check your balance, click on "Balances" and paste your account address. Click "Call" to view your balance.

* If you need to check the token supply, there should be an option available for that purpose.

* To remove tokens from your account, click on "Burn", paste your account address, specify the number of tokens you want to burn (500), and click "Transact" to reduce them from your account.

* After burning tokens, reassess your balance by pressing "Call" to obtain an updated balance. For example, if you burned 500 tokens from a 900 token balance, you should now have 400 tokens remaining.
